### ðŸ‘‹ Where there is a WILL there is a WAY! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full-Stack developer, Blockchain Enthusiast who love to work with JavaScript/Typescript, Blockchain(Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solidity).
Starting from Sep, 2019 began proactively working on blockchain related projects as a Blockchain software engineer.

Nowadays I'm mainly focusing on the DeFi, DEX, NFT development stack, and have interesting bridge development between multi blockchain networks.
